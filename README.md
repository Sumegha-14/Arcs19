India is one of the major developing countries which is facing these issue, we breathe smoke in Delhi, we bathe in wastewater in Ganga river, so we come up with *a solution which will predict the air, water and waste pollution in an area.*

Generally, nowadays our technological devices give us the information of temperature and weather but in additional to this, this IOS-droid app will provide information about pollution in a particular area which would help people suffering from a particular disease or having allergy can plan their travel or manage their way of living.
